    <h3><p><em>Okonomiyaki was invented in Japan prior to World War II and evolved and became popular during and after the war.</em></p></h3> 
    <h3><p><em></em>The earliest origins of a basic crepe-like pancake date back to the Edo period (1683-1868) period where</em></p></h3> 
    <h3><p><em>these were a special desert served at Buddhist ceremonies called Funoyaki.</em></p></h3>

    <h1><p><strong>Let's do some cooking:</strong></p></h1>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Combine cabbage, scallion whites and half of greens, half of beni-shoga, 3/4 of katsuobushi, yamaimo, eggs, and water (or dashi) in a large bowl. Sprinkle with flour. Stir with a fork and beat heavily until a thick batter with plenty of bubbles forms. Set aside.<p></p></h3></li>
        <li><h3><p>If using pork belly, cover the bottom of a 10-inch nonstick skillet with pork belly and set over medium heat. Add okonomiyaki mixture and spread into an even layer with a fork. If not using pork belly, heat vegetable oil in skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add okonomiyaki mixture and spread into an even layer with a fork.</p></h3></li>
        <li><h3><p>Cover and cook, shaking pan occasionally, until bottom layer is crisp and well browned, about 10 minutes, lowering heat as necessary if cabbage threatens to burn.</p></h3></li>
        <li><h3>To flip, drain off any excess fat, then, working over a sink and holding the lid tightly against pan with a pot holder, flip entire pan and lid over so that okonomiyaki transfers to pan lid. Remove pan, then carefully slide okonomiyaki off lid and back into pan, browned side up.<p></p></h3></li>
        <li><h3><p>Return to heat, cover, and continue to cook, shaking gently, until both sides are browned and okonomiyaki is not runny but still custardy and tender in the center, about 8 minutes longer. Transfer to a serving platter, pork side up.</p></h3></li>
        <li><h3><p>Drizzle with okonomiyaki sauce and mayonnaise; sprinkle with ao-nori, remaining beni-shoga, remaining katsuobushi, and remaining scallion greens; and serve immediately off on a communal plate.</p></h3></li>
